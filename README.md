This is a visualizer tool for CSS linear-gradients.

This was first developed on codepen: http://codepen.io/captainbrosset/details/ByqRMB/

I also wrote an article about linear-gradients: https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/do-you-really-understand-css-linear-gradients-631d9a895caf

Note, I deleted the `master` branch on this repo. The default branch is `gh-pages`.

There are some tests in tests.html.
